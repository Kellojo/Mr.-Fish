# Mr. Fish
Mr. Fish is a free fishing bot for Minecraft. It uses sound to operate.

Have fun!
Feel free to do whatever you want with this.

## How to use:

If you want to use the bot without having to focus the Minecraft Window do the following:
1. Navigate to you .minecraft folder (usually in the %appdata% folder - Roaming)
2. Open the options.txt file
3. Find the line "pauseOnLostFocus:true"
4. Change it to "pauseOnLostFocus:false"
5. Restart or start up your game and use it as seen in the video
---> This prevents Minecraft from opening the pause menu when the game window looses focus


## Default Startup
1. select the minecraft process in the combobox.
2. Make sure the displayed values change when breaking blocks.
3. Set the "Auslöser Lautstärke:" or trigger volume to something lower than the sound of the fishing rod.
4. Press "Start" and focus the Minecraft windos.
